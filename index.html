            <p> Are movie critics actually as critical of movies as they say? <br> Are audiences hard to please or are critics just too easily pleased? </p>

                For this bar chart I have split every movie in a year into one of 2 catagories,<br>
                movies where the critic score is higher than the audience score, and movies where <br>
                the audience score is greater than the critic score. After this, I counted the amount of <br>
                movies in each of those catagories that won an oscar and plotted that.<span style="color: rgba(246, 194, 52, 0.631);"> From this we see that <br>
                movies that have higher critic ratings are far more likely to win an oscar than movies that <br>
                have higher audience ratings.</span>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id = "don-chart"><p> I found the difference in the bar graph really intersting. So to investigate I made this lollipop graph. In the graph I have <br>
            plotted the number of movies where the critic score is higher than the audience score, and the number of movies where <br>
            the audience score is greater than the critic score. We can see that critic ratings for movies is far often higher than the audience <br> rating for movies.</p></div>
